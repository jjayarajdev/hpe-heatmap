# Opportunity Intelligence Platform - Implementation Guide
## From Data to Action: Maximizing Opportunity Success

---

## Quick Start: First Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create SQLite database from Excel files
python3 scripts/create_heatmap_db.py

# Verify database created
ls -lh data/heatmap.db
# Should show: 17.06 MB file
```

### Step 2: Launch Application
```bash
# Use the launcher
python3 launch_apps.py
# Select option 1 for Database version (FASTEST)

# Or run directly
streamlit run apps/opportunity_chain_db.py
```

### Step 3: Navigate the Tabbed Interface
The application uses a 4-tab structure for logical workflow:

1. **Overview** - Select opportunities and view basic information
2. **Chain Analysis** - Complete opportunity-to-resources chain visualization
3. **Resources** - Find and assess matched resources with proficiency ratings
4. **Search & Filter** - Advanced filtering and search capabilities

---

## Understanding the Tabbed Interface

### Tab 1: Overview

**Purpose:** Select opportunities and view their basic information

**Key Features:**
- Dropdown to select from 22,002 opportunities
- Display of opportunity details (ID, Name, Stage, Amount, etc.)
- Product Line assignment verification
- Initial chain validation

**Usage:**
```
1. Select an opportunity from the dropdown
2. Review the opportunity details
3. Check if it has a valid Product Line (only 6 PLs have complete chains)
4. Proceed to Chain Analysis tab if PL is mapped
```

### Tab 2: Chain Analysis

**Purpose:** Visualize the complete opportunity-to-resources chain

**Key Features:**
- Product Line mapping display
- Services required for the opportunity
- Skillsets needed for each service
- Individual skills breakdown
- Complete chain visualization

**Valid Product Lines:**
- 60 → Cloud-Native Platforms
- 1Z → Network
- 5V → Hybrid Workplace
- 4J → Education Services
- G4 → Private Platforms
- PD → HPE POD Modular DC

### Tab 3: Resources

**Purpose:** Find and assess resources with required skills

**Key Features:**
- List of matched resources
- Proficiency ratings (2-5 scale)
- Skills count per resource
- Interactive resource drill-down
- Export to Excel functionality

**Proficiency Scale:**
- 5 - Expert
- 4 - Advanced
- 3 - Intermediate
- 2 - Basic

### Tab 4: Search & Filter

**Purpose:** Advanced search and filtering capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Filter by Product Line
- Search by skills or skillsets
- Filter by proficiency levels
- Export filtered results
- Gap analysis tools

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Validation (Day 1)

#### Validate Opportunity Data
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/heatmap.db')

# Check opportunity coverage
query = """
    SELECT [Product Line], COUNT(*) as count
    FROM opportunities
    WHERE [Product Line] IN ('60', '1Z', '5V', '4J', 'G4', 'PD')
    GROUP BY [Product Line]
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(df)
```

#### Verify Skills Data
```python
# Check employee skills coverage
query = """
    SELECT Skill_Set_Name,
           COUNT(DISTINCT Resource_Name) as resources,
           AVG(Proficieny_Rating) as avg_rating
    FROM employee_skills
    WHERE Proficieny_Rating >= 3
    GROUP BY Skill_Set_Name
    ORDER BY resources DESC
"""
skills_coverage = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(skills_coverage.head(20))
```

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis (Day 2-3)

#### Identify Opportunities Without Chains
```python
# Find opportunities without valid PL mapping
query = """
    SELECT [Product Line], COUNT(*) as lost_opportunities
    FROM opportunities
    WHERE [Product Line] NOT IN ('60', '1Z', '5V', '4J', 'G4', 'PD')
      AND [Product Line] IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY [Product Line]
    ORDER BY lost_opportunities DESC
"""
gaps = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(f"Opportunities without chains: {gaps['lost_opportunities'].sum()}")
```

#### Find Critical Skills Gaps
```python
# Identify skillsets with low resource coverage
query = """
    SELECT
        ss.[Skill Set],
        COUNT(DISTINCT es.Resource_Name) as available_resources
    FROM services_skillsets ss
    LEFT JOIN employee_skills es ON ss.[Skill Set] = es.Skill_Set_Name
    WHERE ss.[FY25 PL] IN ('60 (IJ)', '1Z (PN)', '5V (II)', '4J (SX)', 'G4 (PK)', 'PD (C8)')
    GROUP BY ss.[Skill Set]
    HAVING available_resources < 5
    ORDER BY available_resources
"""
critical_gaps = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print("Critical skill gaps:", critical_gaps)
```

### Phase 3: Resource Planning (Day 4-5)

#### Build Resource Matrix
```python
# Create resource availability matrix
query = """
    SELECT
        Resource_Name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT Skill_Certification_Name) as skill_count,
        AVG(Proficieny_Rating) as avg_proficiency,
        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT Skill_Set_Name) as skillsets
    FROM employee_skills
    WHERE Proficieny_Rating >= 3
    GROUP BY Resource_Name
    HAVING skill_count >= 5
    ORDER BY avg_proficiency DESC, skill_count DESC
"""
top_resources = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
```

#### Match Resources to Opportunities
1. Select high-value opportunities in Tab 1
2. Navigate through tabs to identify required skills
3. Use Tab 5 to find matching resources
4. Export resource assignments

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Daily Workflow
```
Morning:
1. Launch database version for fastest performance
2. Review new opportunities in Tab 1
3. Check resource availability in Tab 5

Afternoon:
1. Analyze skill gaps in Tab 4
2. Plan training based on gaps
3. Update resource assignments
```

### 2. Weekly Analysis
```
Monday: Run gap analysis for all opportunities
Tuesday: Review Product Line coverage
Wednesday: Assess resource utilization
Thursday: Plan skill development
Friday: Generate reports for stakeholders
```

### 3. Performance Tips

#### Use Database Version
- 34.6x faster than Excel version
- Consistent query performance
- Better for concurrent users

#### Optimize Queries
```python
# Good: Use indexes
query = "SELECT * FROM opportunities WHERE [Product Line] = ?"

# Bad: Full table scan
query = "SELECT * FROM opportunities WHERE [Opportunity Name] LIKE '%AI%'"
```

#### Cache Results
```python
# Cache frequently used data
@st.cache_data
def load_all_opportunities():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('data/heatmap.db')
    df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM opportunities", conn)
    conn.close()
    return df
```

## Common Use Cases

### Case 1: Urgent Opportunity Assessment
**Scenario:** Sales needs immediate skill feasibility for a large opportunity

**Steps:**
1. Tab 1: Select the opportunity
2. Tab 2: Verify PL mapping exists
3. Tab 4: Check skill requirements
4. Tab 5: Identify available resources
5. Export assessment report

**Time Required:** 5 minutes

### Case 2: Resource Planning for Multiple Opportunities
**Scenario:** Plan resources for next quarter's pipeline

**Steps:**
1. Export all opportunities for the quarter
2. Filter by valid PLs (6 mapped PLs)
3. Aggregate skill requirements
4. Match against resource pool
5. Identify training needs

**Time Required:** 30 minutes

### Case 3: Skills Gap Analysis
**Scenario:** HR needs to plan training programs

**Steps:**
1. Run SQL query for skills gaps
2. Prioritize by opportunity value
3. Group skills into training modules
4. Calculate ROI for training investment

**Time Required:** 1 hour

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No complete chain available"
**Cause:** Opportunity has unmapped Product Line
**Solution:** Only 6 PLs have mappings (60, 1Z, 5V, 4J, G4, PD)

### Issue: Resources show Rating: 0
**Cause:** Using wrong column
**Solution:** Use Proficieny_Rating column (numeric 2-5)

### Issue: Slow performance
**Cause:** Using Excel version
**Solution:** Switch to database version (34.6x faster)

### Issue: Missing skillsets
**Cause:** Skillset name mismatch
**Solution:** Check FY'25 Skillset Name column, handle "No change" cases
